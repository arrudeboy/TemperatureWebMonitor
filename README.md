TemperatureWebMonitor
=====================

The project concerns the security platform implementation for the management and the real-time monitoring inside a HPCC (High
Performance Computing Cluster) environment. The code development is based on open source technologies applied to products such as Netduino Plus, Arduino Yun and Scientific Linux OS.
The project specifications document is part of an electronic engineer thesis grade. If you want to view the full documentation for learning more about this, please contact me by sending an email to the email address that appears in the section below.


MAIN NOTES:

 - I assume that who try to implement this project has basic knowledge about Arduino boards and Linux environments. Otherwise, please visit the Arduino Yun official web site for gettting started (http://arduino.cc/en/Guide/ArduinoYun).
 
 - I've wrote a complete tutorial for mounting the entire scenario project. It includes IDE installation for Arduino Yun developers, the setup to starting up the web server into the board, and some others configurations. The tuturial is only in Spanish version. In order to get the tutorial, please write me an email to arturofelixchari@gmail.com.
 
 - For watch this project application running please go to my demostration video in youtube (http://youtu.be/Emm25DyEQ_M)
